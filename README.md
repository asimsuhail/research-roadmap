The **80/20 principle** (also known as the **Pareto Principle**) suggests that roughly 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort. When applied to learning about APIs, this means focusing on the core concepts, technologies, and tools that will give you the majority of the value, rather than trying to learn everything about APIs. Below is a **weekly schedule** to learn about APIs using the 80/20 approach.

We'll focus on the key concepts, tools, and technologies that will help you master most APIs, and I'll aim to keep each week practical and manageable.

### Week 1: **Introduction to APIs & HTTP Basics**
Focus on understanding the foundation of APIs, the most common protocol (HTTP), and how web communication works.

#### Key Topics:
- **What is an API?**
  - Definition and real-world examples.
  - Types of APIs: Web APIs, REST APIs, SOAP APIs, GraphQL APIs, etc.
  - Why APIs are important in modern software development.

- **HTTP Basics**
  - What is HTTP? HTTP vs HTTPS.
  - Common HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
  - HTTP Status Codes (200, 400, 404, 500).

- **Basic Authentication**
  - How authentication works in APIs (Basic Auth, API Keys).
  - Difference between public and private APIs.

#### Practical:
- Make a simple `GET` request to a public API (e.g., `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`) using a tool like Postman or `curl`.

---

### Week 2: **RESTful APIs and CRUD Operations**
REST (Representational State Transfer) is the most common architecture for building APIs. In this week, you'll focus on how REST APIs are structured and how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

#### Key Topics:
- **RESTful Principles**
  - REST architecture and principles (Stateless, Client-Server, Uniform Interface).
  - REST resources and URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).
  - REST conventions (using HTTP methods correctly, naming conventions for endpoints).

- **CRUD Operations**
  - Create: `POST` request.
  - Read: `GET` request.
  - Update: `PUT` or `PATCH` request.
  - Delete: `DELETE` request.

#### Practical:
- Make a `POST` request to create a new resource.
- Make a `PUT` request to update a resource.
- Make a `DELETE` request to remove a resource.

---

### Week 3: **Authentication & Authorization in APIs**
Understanding authentication and authorization is key when working with real-world APIs, especially for securing access to sensitive data.

#### Key Topics:
- **OAuth 2.0**
  - The OAuth flow: Authorization Code Flow, Implicit Flow, Client Credentials Flow.
  - Difference between **Authentication** and **Authorization**.
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and how they are used in APIs.

- **API Keys**
  - How API keys work for authentication and authorization.
  - Rate limiting and quotas in APIs.

#### Practical:
- Use Postman or `curl` to make an authenticated API request using OAuth 2.0 (e.g., connect to GitHub API, Twitter API, etc.).
- Use an API key to access a third-party API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).

---

### Week 4: **JSON & Data Serialization**
APIs often exchange data in JSON format, so understanding how to serialize/deserialize JSON is crucial.

#### Key Topics:
- **JSON Basics**
  - What is JSON? Structure and syntax.
  - Differences between JSON and XML.
  - How to parse and generate JSON in different programming languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.).

- **Data Serialization**
  - Serialize objects to JSON and deserialize JSON to objects.
  - Error handling when dealing with malformed JSON.

#### Practical:
- Make a `GET` request to an API that returns JSON (e.g., `https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice/BTC.json`).
- Parse the returned JSON data in a programming language of your choice (JavaScript, Python, etc.).

---

### Week 5: **API Rate Limiting, Pagination & Versioning**
Learn how APIs handle large datasets and control access by limiting request rates.

#### Key Topics:
- **Rate Limiting**
  - What is rate limiting? Why itâ€™s important.
  - Common rate-limiting strategies (e.g., Leaky Bucket, Token Bucket).
  - Handling rate-limited responses in your code.

- **Pagination**
  - How to handle paginated responses (i.e., breaking up large data sets into smaller chunks).
  - Common pagination strategies: offset-based, cursor-based, etc.

- **API Versioning**
  - Why versioning APIs is important.
  - Different versioning strategies: URI versioning, header versioning, query parameter versioning.

#### Practical:
- Explore an API that uses pagination (e.g., GitHub API for listing repositories or issues).
- Handle a rate-limited response and retry after a specific delay.

---

### Week 6: **GraphQL APIs**
While REST APIs are the most common, GraphQL has gained popularity due to its flexibility in fetching only the data you need.

#### Key Topics:
- **What is GraphQL?**
  - The difference between GraphQL and REST.
  - How GraphQL works (Query, Mutation, Subscription).
  - GraphQL Schema and Resolvers.

- **Querying in GraphQL**
  - How to write basic GraphQL queries to request specific data.
  - Nested queries in GraphQL.

#### Practical:
- Make a simple query using a public GraphQL API (e.g., GitHub GraphQL API).
- Create a mutation to modify data via GraphQL.

---

### Week 7: **API Testing & Documentation**
Learn how to properly test APIs and how to create useful API documentation for others to consume your API.

#### Key Topics:
- **Testing APIs**
  - Introduction to API testing tools (Postman, Insomnia).
  - Writing tests for APIs (unit testing for endpoints, integration tests).
  - Mocking APIs for testing.

- **API Documentation**
  - Best practices for documenting APIs.
  - Tools for generating API docs: Swagger/OpenAPI, Postman collections.

#### Practical:
- Write test cases for your API using Postman.
- Create basic API documentation using Swagger or Postman.

---

### Week 8: **Real-World API Integration & Projects**
This week, focus on integrating APIs into real-world projects to solidify your learning and apply your knowledge.

#### Key Topics:
- **Integrating APIs into Applications**
  - How to connect APIs to the front-end (JavaScript, React, Angular).
  - How to use APIs in back-end applications (Node.js, Python, Ruby).

- **Error Handling & Security**
  - Common API errors and how to handle them.
  - Protecting APIs from abuse (CORS, IP Whitelisting, rate limiting).

#### Practical:
- Integrate a public API (like weather data or a social media API) into a small project.
- Handle API errors gracefully and display meaningful error messages.
